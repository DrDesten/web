    <p class="paragraph">
      DrDesten's MinecraftShaders is a shaderpack for Minecraft that I started developing in order to learn glsl.
      It has grown a lot since its early days and has turned into a rather mature shader with an emphasis on performance. <br>
      It offers a distinct visual look with bright colors, vanilla-style lighting and strong AO.
      I am always working on improving it, but I do have a tight performance budget as I want it to run well low-end systems. <br>
      You can download it on <a href="http://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/drdestens-minecraftshaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curseforge</a>.

    <h3 class="paragraph">Stracciatella Shaders</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Stracciatella is a shaderpack which aims to enhance the vanilla experience without sacrificing performance or changing the vanilla style.
      It allows for extensive customization in almost all aspects of the game, like lightmap or sky colors. It also fixes vanillas broken fog and adds some new features which go nicely with the vanilla style.
      This would for example be rain refraction, which distorts the image behind raindrops as well as rain puddles which show the vanilla water texture instead of realistic reflections.<br>
      All features of this shader are completely optional, so you can pick and choose how <b>you</b> want your vanilla experience.
      You can download Stracciatella on <a href="http://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/stracciatella-shaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curseforge</a>.
