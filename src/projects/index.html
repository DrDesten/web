        <p class="paragraph">
            DrDesten's MinecraftShaders is a shaderpack for Minecraft that I started developing in order to learn glsl.
            It has grown a lot since its early days and has turned into a rather mature shader with an emphasis on
            performance. <br>
            It offers a distinct visual look with bright colors, vanilla-style lighting and strong AO.
            I am always working on improving it, but I do have a tight performance budget as I want it to run well low-end
            systems. <br>
            You can download it on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/drdestens-minecraftshaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curseforge</a>.

    <Paragraph title="Stracciatella Shaders" id="stracc-shader">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Stracciatella is a shaderpack which aims to enhance the vanilla experience without sacrificing performance or
            changing the vanilla style.
            It allows for extensive customization in almost all aspects of the game, like lightmap or sky colors. It also
            fixes vanillas broken fog and adds some new features which go nicely with the vanilla style.
            This would for example be rain refraction, which distorts the image behind raindrops as well as rain puddles which
            show the vanilla water texture instead of realistic reflections.<br>
            All features of this shader are completely optional, so you can pick and choose how <b>you</b> want your vanilla
            experience.
            You can download Stracciatella on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/stracciatella-shaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curseforge</a>.

    <Paragraph title="Automatic Semicolon Insertion for GLSL" id="asi-glsl">
        <p class="paragraph">
            ASI for GLSL is a VSCode extension that adds automatic semicolon insertion to GLSL. It's a formatter that detects
            where to place semicolons when you run it.<br>
            I created this extension because I grew more and more annoyed at forgetting semicolons in my programs and decided
            that I had to do something about it. Now, with the extension, you'll never have to worry about forgetting
            semicolons ever again!<br>
            I've also started adding other quality of life improvements to the extension. For example, I made parentheses
            around if and for statements optional and added a shorthand synatax for for loops.<br>
            You can find the extension on the Microsoft Marketplace from within VSCode or download it directly from <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DrDesten.asi-glsl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
